# Bouncing-Ball-Animation-Using-Maya
#Aim:
To animate a bouncing ball using Maya

#Procedure:
Step 1: Drop a simple polygon sphere into the scene.

Step 2: To get started the first thing you will want to do is open up your Animation Preferences located at the bottom right of Maya.

Step 3: Once opened make sure that you have the Time Slider selected under the categories panel.

Step 4: Make sure that the Auto key box is checked, this makes it so any changes you make to ball will be automatically keyframed.

Step 5: Click on the Time Slider, and drag it until it's on frame 1. Select the ball and translate it up in the Y axis, set it to a value of 38.

Step 6: Now with the ball still selected, press the "S" key.

Step 7: Go to frame 9 on your Time Slider, and change the Translate Y value to 0. The value of 0 represents the value of when the ball hits the ground.

Step 8: Let's continue this procedure for the rest of the bounces

Step 9: Use the graph editor to make the bounces look real in animation.

Step 10: The high points of the bounces should have a tangent handle that is very wide, and tangent handles on the keyframes where the ball hits the ground should be brought inward like before.

#Output:

#Result:
Therefore a bouncing ball is animated successfully using maya
